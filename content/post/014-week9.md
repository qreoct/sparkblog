## Weekly Summary

This week, while waiting for the feedbacks to come streaming in, we decided to do some clean up and refactoring of our code. Refactoring basically means to restructure code into neater and
imporve readablity without changing the undyling logic. It could range from following naming conventions to having some kind of application structure. While the purpose of restructuring code
might appear to be a little trival (or even redundant) at first, there are many benefits to refactoring.

### Why refactor?

1. Refactoring code makes it cleaner and easier to read, allowing you as well as your team to understand them quicker.
2. Cleaner code also means it is easier to maintain in the future
3. Refactoring code to follow good software engineering practices such as abstraction principles enables code to be reuse and prevent repeating code

### Backend Refactoring

Previously, a lot of the websocket logic is placed inside the index.js file which is really untidy and difficult to read.

***index.js***
```
const app = require('./app')
const http = require('http')
const config = require('./utils/config')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')
const socketio = require('socket.io')

const server = http.createServer(app)
const io = socketio(server)

io.on('connection', socket => {
  console.log(`a socket with userID ${socket.userID} has connected`)

  socket.on('create', () => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('joining', async (roomCode, callback) => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('join', (roomCode) => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('waiting', (empty, callback) => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('leaveWaiting', () => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('setQuestions', (questions) => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('nextQuestion', () => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('private message', ({ content }) => {
    ...logic
  })

  socket.on('leave', () => {
    ...logic
  })
})

server.listen(config.PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
})
```

After refactoring, the index.js file is a lot cleaner!
***index.js***
```
const app = require('./app')
const http = require('http')
const config = require('./utils/config')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')
const server = http.createServer(app)
const { userMiddleware } = require('./socket.io/utils/middleware')

const io = require('socket.io')(server)
io.use(userMiddleware)
const registerEventHandler = require('./socket.io/eventHandler')
const onConnection = (socket) => {
  registerEventHandler(io, socket)
}

io.on('connection', onConnection)

server.listen(config.PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
})
```


### Redux Ducks

For the frontend, we decided to use redux ducks for the application structure. Redux ducks suggests that we put related actions, actions creators and reducers into a single file. This make it
really easy to see how each action is called and how that change the state of the store. Rudux ducks is perfect for a small/medium scale project like ours as we do not have complicated reducers
making our code look ugly. For the github reop on redux ducks, you can [click here](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux). For a video on difference between conventional structure vs
redux ducks, you can [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn9Y76Naw_U)
