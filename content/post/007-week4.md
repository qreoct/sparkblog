## Weekly summary

It's already June! This means our Milestone 1 has been reached. If you haven't seen it yet, [go check out our demo](/post/005-milestone1)! This week, we worked on getting out the demo into a heroku deployment, cleaning up some of our backend API, as well as working further on the frontend features.

## Writing Questions

What makes a good question? We wrote [a post earlier about questions](/post/006-askingquestions), and this week we worked hard on improving our question bank! In **SPARK**, we have various categories with a huge selection of questions that can lead to all kinds of conversations.

We curated a list of over 300 questions that are sure to be relevant and insightful to anyone. The questions come from our own experiences with conversations, looking around online at what others have to say, as well as asking our friends about the types of conversations they enjoy!

On the more technical side of things, these questions are stored in a collaboroative spreadsheet where we can easily make changes as required. Then, the questions are exported as a .csv document, formatted to JSON, and uploaded to our MongoDB database. Updates are really quick, and everything is sorted into its appropriate category!

## Question Cards

With great questions comes... great question cards. We wrote a little update to the Question Cards so that they're much more enjoyable to use.

We went through a bunch of libraries that implement draggable/swipeable cards in React. The one we like the most so far is (react-tinder-card)[https://github.com/3DJakob/react-tinder-card] by 3DJakob, although we might tweak some animation values. It works great on mobile and desktop!

Finally, rendering many Question Cards on the screen at once is never a good idea. With too many React Components on screen, performance takes a huge hit. Thus, there's a need to incrementally load the cards as the user scrolls through them. More details on our implementation in the future!

## Summary

We're nearly a third of our way along this journey! This month, there's going to be a lot of hard work to get all our proposed features working. We are especially excited for the real-time chat feature!

But of course, take things one step at a time. Here's a reminder (for ourselves, more than anything!):

~~What have you learned this week? Did you record it somewhere?~~
