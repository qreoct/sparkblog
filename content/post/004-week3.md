## Weekly summary
So week 3 is almost coming to an end and we are left with 2 days to our first milestone! Along the way, we were met with some obstacles and had to make some difficult decisions. But what's a journey 
without any obstacle right?

## Mentor-less
Unfortunately, we weren't matched with a mentor because our project may not be "technical" enough. While we embark on this project knowing full well that this is an issue that would arise, not having 
a mentor does pose a challenge to us futher down the road. After meetiing with our advisor for guidance, he encouraged us to expand on the app complexity. We made the decision to come up with a real-
time matchmaking system to allow friends (and strangers) to converse remotely. Perfect for this Covid period! Honestly, if you ask me, this might be a blessing in disguise because we are now not 
bogged down by the expectations of our mentor and have the freedom to do things the way we want it. Who knows?

## Backend
We manage to set up a server connected to a database as well as make api calls to Unsplashi api. Unsplash is a website dedicated to sharing stock photo and has an extensive library of photos
from a myriad of categories. Making request to unsplash api is also really simple. I had a lot of fun learning how to use it.

## Summary
"To get through the hardest journey, we need take only one step at a time, but we must keep on stepping."
