## Weekly summary

Week 5 is over!

## Google Fonts

You might have noticed cleaner fonts if you're viewing this blog on mobile. Well, that was what it was intended to be like from the start, but somehow the Google fonts we were using only rendered on desktops, but not mobile.

Finally I found a solution, which was importing the webfont specifically in the `<head>` tag, rather than an `@import` statement in the stylesheet.

As a visual example, go from this:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Barlow+Condensed");
```

to this:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Barlow+Condensed" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```
