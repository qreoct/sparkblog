## Weekly summary

Week 5 is over! Not much in terms of new features, since we're still working towards getting the group modes working properly and efficiently. This week's post will be about some little learnings we've made!

## Google Fonts

You might have noticed cleaner fonts if you're viewing this blog on mobile. Well, that was what it was intended to be like from the start, but somehow the Google fonts we were using only rendered on desktops, but not mobile.

Finally I found a solution, which was importing the webfont specifically in the `<head>` tag, rather than an `@import` statement in the stylesheet.

As a visual example, go from this:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Barlow+Condensed");
```

to this:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Barlow+Condensed" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

## Small weird errors

Small weird errors pop up all the time when programming, it's just a fact of this line of work. Here's one that happened this week!

We have a staging version of **SPARK** that's hosted *somewhere* which is used to test our changes before pushing it to production. Usually it's a good idea to have a separate staging environment such that you can run tests on a public environment, instead of a local dev environment.

Anyway, the way that we initially set up the staging environment was exactly the same as the production environment. This means that everything, down to the config vars was the same. 

Then, we were working on the rendering of Question Cards, so things were working normally. However, when we did a full test of the staging environment, everything worked, *except for the Pictures API*!

This was strange, because every line of code was exactly the same, and yet something which was working fine in production was failing in the staging environment. Checking the network logs showed that there was a [500 Internal Server Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/Http/status/500) in our call to our API.

Checking through our Heroku logs, it seems like it was an error with the Authorization. This led me to believe that it had to be a problem with our Unsplash integration! But, checking all the details, like the API key, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

*...or was it?*

Turns out, there was a stray newline character (`\n`) in the API Key when we copied it over! A sneaky, invisible character like this is able to cause a pretty difficult-to-track problem!

Luckily, when working on large projects, there are tools like logs, (and the wonders of Internet search engines) which help us to diagnose issues and find out what's wrong. But it still takes a good mix of intuition and experience to solve such *"small weird errors"*. Part and parcel of development!

## Summary

Well, not much in terms of features this week, but any progress is still progress! Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in comparisons and expectations (from yourself *and* others), that we neglect the growth that we experience within ourselves.

~~What is something that you are grateful for?~~
