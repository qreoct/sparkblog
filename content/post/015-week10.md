## Weekly Summary

The finish line is almost approaching! Week 10 is complete, and our app is pretty much complete, feature-wise. We spent the week working on **testing**, and all that's left is polish before Milestone 3! In this article, we'll talk about **the 3 types of tests**, based on Mike Cohn's idea of the Software Testing Pyramid.

## What is testing anyway?

Well, [as Uncle Bob puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM), "software is science". Science is this branch of knowledge that you and I risk our lives on everyday, but what is Science other than testing? The rocket can be engineered and built, but ultimately safety can only be guaranteed to 99.99% expectancy, where these numbers come from calculations and tests.

The only true way to know if Science works or not, is to test it, but that doesn't actually prove that it works! It only proves that it doesn't *not* work.

In software, writing tests then serves as one of the ways to "prove *not* incorrectness" of the code that has been written. Having multiple tests, of different types, and of sufficient coverage, is necessary.

## Unit Tests

The first type of tests that exist are Unit Tests. These are usually isolated tests, written to test particular components or functions independent of one another.

In our React frontend, using `react-testing-library` allows us to perform tests on single Components, rendering it as if that was the only Component in our application. This allows us to guarantee the workings of state within the Component, for example.

As our backend is an API, we then have to test each endpoint to ensure that it returns a correct result. Using `jest`, a testing library, we created a mock database for our questions. It looks a little similar to this:

```json
[
  {
    "category": ["icebreakers"],
    "question": "icebreaker qn lv 1",
    "level": "1",
    "canPicture": false
  },
  {
    "category": ["icebreakers"],
    "question": "icebreaker qn lv 2",
    "level": "2",
    "canPicture": false
  },
  {
    "category": ["icebreakers"],
    "question": "icebreaker qn lv 3",
    "level": "3",
    "canPicture": false
  },
  {
    "category": ["this-or-that"],
    "question": "this or that long question",
    "this": "this",
    "that": "that",
    "level": "1",
    "canPicture": false
  } 
...other entries...
]
```

Instead of having the 600+ hand-crafted questions from our Question Bank, it was clearer to use specific testing-related questions. This ensured that our tests could be **replicated** and were **consistent**.

In addition to testing out our API, we also wrote unit tests for our Online Mode features, ensuring that the socket connections worked and were able to send messages.

## Integration Tests

The next type of testing involves Integration Tests. This means bringing components out of isolation.

In the frontend, we achieved this by testing components that relied on one another. The `SoloInput.js` component, part of the Solo Mode, is one such Component that relies on `QuestionCard`, `PictureCard`, and also user interaction to select a picture and write down their reflections.

`react-testing-library` was used to check whether the child components were rendered. Subsequently, we could interact programmatically with the buttons, and ensure that errors were handled properly. Here's an example of one of the integration tests:

## End-to-End Testing

Finally, End-to-End Testing (E2E) wraps everything together. The reason for these fully-integrated tests are to ensure that UI works, just like how a user would use it. We wrote tests for all our main features: **Group Mode, Online Mode**, and **Solo Mode**.

Using libraries like **Cypress**, we're able to write tests which open up a browser, interact with the site like a user would, and automatically assert various tests for us!

It was a major step up from manually clicking through our site countless times during development! What's more, it was quick! This animation shows how fast the test suite runs in real-time!

## Summary

To say that we learned a lot would be an understatement! Writing tests, we realized, was not as straightforward as we thought! However, like many things, it's good to start early and write many tests, as it saves a lot on development time and finding bugs automatically is always great.

I'd say that the biggest takeaway was learning how much could truly be automated. Cypress as an E2E testing library really made testing features and workflows so much quicker. We are looking to combine this together with CI/CD, to streamline this process even further. Onward to Milestone 3!
