## Weekly Summary

Week 7 is over and we are a a little late on our weekly logs oops :")
That's because we are working really hard to make sure the our app is *perfect*

## Real time chat

Now our real time chat feature is finally up and you can chat with anyone around the
world by simply creating a room (or get paired with a total stranger in the random room,
up to you :D)

## Desgin considerations

So one of the thing about web developing is design considerations and one of which  we
had to ponder about is whether to save the users in an array of users with roomcode as
its field,

```javascript
[
{roomcode: '1234'},
{roomccode: 'abcd'},
...
]
```

or to save the users in an array of rooms with userID as its field?

```javascript
[
{userID: 'ab12'},
{userID: 'xy34'}
...
]
```

The answer? There is no 'right' way to do things. Both works in my opinion but i decided
to go for the latter because it's easier for me to visualise (in my head) having users in
rooms as opposed to users having a roomcode.

## Like and Share

To be able to share content is really important nowadays, especially with social media and all sorts of other messaging platforms. We knew we wanted the ability to (1) add Questions that we liked to a personal Favourites bank, as well as (2) Share Questions with others.

## Summary

With our milestone 2 up and running, we'll now be moving on to testing. Hope the journey
would be a smooth one (probably not) , but we can have hope :)

~~What did you hope to be when you grow up as a kid?~~
