## Weekly Summary

Week 7 is over and we are a a little late on our weekly logs oops :")
That's because we are working really hard to make sure the our app is *perfect*.

## Real time chat

Now our real time chat feature is finally up and you can chat with anyone around the
world by simply creating a room (or get paired with a total stranger in the random room,
up to you :D)

## Desgin considerations

One of the thing about web developing (and honestly any kind of engineering in general) is design considerations. One of which we had to ponder about was whether to save the users in an array of users with roomcode as its field,

```javascript
[
 {roomcode: '1234'},
 {roomccode: 'abcd'},
...
]
```

or to save the users in an array of rooms with userID as its field?

```javascript
[
 {userID: 'ab12'},
 {userID: 'xy34'}
...
]
```

The answer? There is no 'right' way to do things. Both works in my opinion but I decided
to go for the latter because it's easier for me to visualise (in my head) having users in
rooms as opposed to users having a roomcode.

Ultimately, as we've come to realize many times along this journey, is that we often have to make decisions in any software project. After weighing the pros and cons of each option, if a choice seems difficult, just make a choice right then and there! Then, it's even better to document your decision, so that you can look back on it in the future!

While it's good to spend time thinking about your code and the overall architecture of the project, it's also equally important to write out the code, to actually have something to present!

## Summary

With our [Milestone 2](/post/011-milestone2) up and running, we'll now be moving on to testing. Hope the journey
would be a smooth one (probably not), but we can have hope :)

~~What did you hope to be when you grow up as a kid?~~
