## Milestone 3

Milestone 3 is finally here!! :partying_face: :balloon:

Orbital was a really fun journey for both of us, and we've learned so much along the way. Want to delve deeper into SPARK and get more details on how we've implemented it? You can find our code on [Github](https://github.com/qreoct/spark), as well as our [writeup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rBX3eTu-_Ej0wZ66G5d3ZcEXTdBqhxs4/view?usp=sharing).

As usual, we've deployed our app [here](https://sparkorbital.herokuapp.com) where you can check it out!

Well, this marks the end of Orbital for us. We might be fixing some small bugs here and there, and we certainly welcome any feature requests. However, we're really happy how things turned out in the end.

Back to enjoying our time in the semester~! **To all that have stayed with us -- and those in the future that are curious about the Orbital journey -- thank you, and stay curious.**
