Hello! We are [Jefferson](https://github.com/qreoct) & [Rui Quan](https://github.com/tanruiquan), two Year 1 Computer Science students from NUS.

In a bout of procrastination, we (mainly Jeff...) have decided to start a blog. This blog will serve as a development log of our Orbital project, and probably something to waste time on when we're tired of working on the app itself.

If you're following us along in your Orbital 2021 journey, or someone from the future wondering what Orbital is like, read on! :rocket:

## What is Orbital?

>[Orbital](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg) (a.k.a., CP2106: Independent Software Development Project) is the School of Computingâ€™s 1st year summer self-directed, independent work course. This programme gives students the opportunity to pick up software development skills on their own, using sources on the web. All while receiving course credit in the form of 4 modular credits of Unrestricted Electives (UE).

>SoC provides the Orbital framework for helping students stay motivated and driven to complete a project of their own design, by structuring peer evaluation, critique and presentation milestones over the summer period.

Both of us are really excited to be taking part in Orbital this year. We will be building a web-app using React.

## Our project

Our project is inspired by the power of asking questions. We are members of [Facilitators@NUS](https://www.instagram.com/facilitators.nus/), which is a club devoted to learning new facilitation skills. One such skill is knowing how to ask great questions.

We believe that questions are the way to create meaningful conversations. We want to make the tool of great questions available to anyone. This is why we want to create an app, full of carefully curated questions that is certain to spark interesting and meaningful conversations.

Our app is called SPARK, and we hope that it will be a bold call to people to ask questions, stay curious, and make meaningful conversations.

## This blog

This blog will be a development log for SPARK. It uses the static site generator Hugo, and is hosted on Netlify. The theme was created from scratch, and source code containing the theme can be found on [Github](https://github.com/qreoct/sparkblog) :)

We aim to post:
1. weekly development logs of our progress
2. fun teasers for upcoming features
3. great tips and content about asking questions and how to make meaningful conversations

## Closing

That's all for this post now, stay tuned for our updates! We'll leave you with a question to think about:

~~What's the best conversation you've ever had?~~
