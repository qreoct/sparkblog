## Weekly Summary

Woohoo! Week 1 is done! This week was a week full of opportunities and exploration. We explored our app and its features in more detail, drafted out a timeline of work, completed a publicity poster as well as teaser video!

We also started going deep into the tech stack that we'll be using, learning all the relevant skills and taking whatever courses there are. Jefferson really recommends the [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course! Orbital also provides various workshops on these technologies.
