## Weekly Summary
Week 2 is complete! Slightly over a week left to go for our first milestone, and we're really excited to show you a demonstration of our project for you to play with! But first, let's cover what we did over this week.

## Wireframes
Before any code goes into a project, it's always a great idea to draw out and identify what we want to build. This is not only for the designer/front-end engineer to have a better idea of how they can develop your ideas into reality, but it's also a way for the people doing the project to understand your user needs.

Always think from the perspective of your user! How will they behave when navigating through your app. What are the things they expect, from their assumptions of using similar apps in the past? Are we doing anything different, or are we using these assumptions to our advantage?

We created a couple of sketches detailing the flow of our application. Here's a small page from my notebook :P Afterwards, we brought it online to tools such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to get a clearer picture of what we have to develop (Components-wise).

## Decisions
One of the pretty major decisions we've made at this point is deciding between React and React Native. Although the platforms might appear similar, there were some key differences that we had to account for.

**React Native** is really flexible in the sense that you can develop for both iOS and Android using one codebase. Certainly, it's interesting to have our app be on an app store, and downloaded by many people. However, we don't have native iOS devices for testing, and we want people to access our app as easily as possible, so a web-app makes more sense.

**React** has been around for a bit longer, so the ecosystem is larger. There's all sorts of libraries that we can use, such as testing libraries, integrations with various platforms, and components that others have already built. For app-development, it's perhaps better to develop natively, such as using Swift or Java. Something to look into for the future :)

Certainly, these might just be assumptions that we, new developers, are making. It's really early on in our project, but we foresee many more decisions like this coming our way. Writing them down is a good way to remind ourselves (in the future!) what our assumptions were.

## Summary
We're really excited to show you what we have, and can't wait for Milestone 1 to come (or actually, it can wait a few weeks more... heh). As always, we leave you with a question.

~~What's an assumption about things in life that you've been making? Are these assumptions valid?~~
