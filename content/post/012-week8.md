## Weekly Summary

[Milestone 2](/post/011-milestone2) is out! We've worked pretty hard on this, and we're even more excited to continue polishing **SPARK**. Watch out for Milestone 3!

Orbital (the program we're on) has a peer evaluation system at every Milestone. This means that other teams have a chance to give feedback on other teams' work. Feedback is a great way to learn as well as improve! If you run into any issues and you want to give feedback on **SPARK**, feel free to raise an issue on our Github page!

## Like and Share

To be able to share content is really important nowadays, especially with social media and all sorts of other messaging platforms. With the amount of connectivity in today's world, we absolutely had to have some kind of social interaction in our app (on top of the Online Mode!)

We knew we wanted the ability to (1) add Questions that we liked to a personal Favourites bank, as well as (2) Share Questions with others.

To achieve the 'favourites' functionality, it was just a question of being able to add questions into a Favourites bank. However, one thing which was considered in our design was as to whether to write this to a database of some sort. After all, being able to link an individual to their favourites meant they needed some sort of account to track it down.

However, after much discussion, we felt that having account systems detracted from the simplicity and intentionality of using **SPARK**. Ultimately, the app should be a reflection tool, free of judgement, which includes having the peace of mind that no personal content will be stored on a server of any sort.

Thus, we decided to use a localstorage solution to track the Favourites of a user, as well as their Journal entries. This way, privacy is guaranteed, and users can be assured that their ideas and meaningful connections stay among those that matter to them.

Secondly, for our cards, we still wanted a way for users to share the questions which were meaningful to them. Luckily, this was easy to implement using the [Web Share API](https://web.dev/web-share/) that has been around for quite some time. 

It's a simple, yet robust system to be able to share content across the web in a natural way. Upon clicking on the 'share' button on any Question Card, users can share the Question which is on the card, to text messaging apps or Social Media platforms!

For systems that do not support this API, however, the simplest solution works. We copy the question to the user's clipboard!

## Summary
With the popularity of social media and social connections, it was important that our app had some way to maintain this integration. Not only that, ensuring privacy and that users have the right to not have their data stored on servers, is also a massively important goal of our app.

See you in the next update!
