## Questions
What are questions? Why are they important? Why are there so many questions? How do you ask good questions? Will the next sentence also be a question?

In our very first *Aside*, we want to talk about why questions are so powerful, and some ways you can up your game in asking questions. We promise that these tips are useful not just when using **SPARK**, but also in your own conversations!

## Why are questions important?

### Questions solve problems
Marilee Adams, author of *Change Your Questions, Change Your Life*, once said this -- "To solve your problems, ask better questions".

Although questions might not be always present in our everyday life, I'm certain that problems exist. How good would it be if our problems just could go away!

However, this is not always the case. One aspect that makes questions so important, in my opinion, is that it allows us to reframe our thinking. We often find ourselves stuck in our problems, lost on the next step to take in order to solve it. Certainly, if a good question comes our way, we might be able to think of a creative solution to the problem!

Albert Einstein (supposedly) said it best:

~~We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.~~

### Questions make meaningful connections
Ever had a conversation with somebody, but it just reached a dead end? Similar to being lost in the woods, sometimes you wish that you just had a map to help you navigate through the conversation and get to the beautiful lake at the end of your journey.

Well, while [having great conversation starters](/post/001-helloworld) are important, it's equally important to know how to continue these conversations, to turn them into truly meaningful connections!

Asking questions in an intentional way, to elaborate further and allow for deeper sharing, is a great technique in order to elevate your conversations with friends and family to the next level. Of course, certain conversation skills like Active Listening need to be present, but that is out of the scope of this post.

## What kind of questions are there?
In general, we can classify questions that are useful for conversations and solving problems into three categories. The acronym **'CORE questions'** is useful to help remember them.

### Closed/Open Ended Questions
**C**losed-ended and **O**pen-ended questions form the basis of questioning. These are the foundation by which all questions are built upon!

**C**losed-ended questions focus on answers that are straightforward. They usually refer to the 'What's, 'Where's, 'Who's, and 'When's of the conversation. However, they do not necessarily need to be factual. **C**losed-ended questions are a great base to start a conversation with, which you can drive further with **O**pen-ended questions.

**O**pen-ended questions are questions that require a little bit more thought into it. Usually, it encourages the recipient to think deeper, possibly providing answers based on their feelings, emotions, values, and morals. [Simon Sinek talks about starting with 'Why', and the Golden Circle concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4). The **O**pen-ended questions here help to push your conversations, and thinking, to the next level!

### Redirective Questions
**R**edirective questions refer to questions that require thinking from different perspectives. Much like how a mirror redirects the light from what it's pointing at, redirective questions allow you and the listener to ponder further, and *reflect* deeply on the question posed.

What's an example of a **R**edirective question? In a group conversation, you might say *"Now that we've heard what John has said, what do the rest of you think about it?"*

In a problem-solving context, a **R**edirective question can be posed to yourself, asking *"How would my idol/mentor handle this situation?"* or *"I've looked at the negative side of things, is there a positive spin on the problem that I have yet to consider"*?

The idea is to allow our thoughts to flow like water, to be more flexible and easily redirected. In this way, our ideas become more creative, conversations get more engaging, and ultimately more meaningful.

### Elaborative Questions
Finally, **E**laborative questions are questions that dig deeper into the topic. Probably the simplest **E**laborative question there is in the English language is "Why?"

The car manufacturing company [Toyota has famously used the "Five Whys" method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) to improve its manufacturing methods. It simply consists of asking yourself "Why?", answering it, then asking "Why?" to that answer, five times.

While this might not be always ideal for *all* conversations, asking "Why" to get to the root of the topic is a great way to find out what the other person might be thinking and assuming. It's easy to impose our own assumptions on things, both in conversations and while problem-solving, so stripping it down to [First Principles Thinking](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles) by asking **E**laborative questions are a great way to find clarity in any situation.

Some more examples of **E**laborative questions:
- When did you first realize this?
- Why do you believe this?
- Who was it that made you aware of this problem? Are they trustworthy?

## So what?
Well then, what do we do now that we know these question categories? Certainly, it's important to have a go at practicing them. Try our asking different types of questions, in different situations! See if you can use Elaborative Questions to dig deeper into a topic that people don't usually share about, or use Redirective Questions to create a more inclusive and lively group discussion.

The possibilites are endless! After all, **ask good questions, get meaningful conversations.**

As usual, we'll end off with a question. We hope that you enjoy these little tidbits of knowledge, because we enjoy talking about them!
