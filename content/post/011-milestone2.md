## Milestone 2

We've reached Milestone 2! This is a large milestone for **SPARK**, because it contains our full features!

Some of the new features we've added, which we'd love for you to try out:

- **Solo mode**: Solo mode is made for reflection! Every day, users receive 3 questions that they can write an answer for. The reflections are saved in the user Journey, that users can revisit.
- **Group mode**: Group mode contains questions from different categories. This mode is best played in-person, where one player accesses the app, and swipes through to pick questions for the rest of the group.
- **Online chat mode**: Take your conversations and questions online! Pair up with a stranger, or someone you know, and enjoy learning more about one another!

Our Milestone can [be tried here](https://sparkorbital.herokuapp.com).

As for Milestone 3, we're working on refining the look and feel of the app, as well as setting up robust test suites, together with CI/CD. Stay tuned!
